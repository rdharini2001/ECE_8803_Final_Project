# ECE_8803_Final_Project
Project: Biomarker Analysis on OLIVES dataset <br>
 • Dataset download: https://zenodo.org/records/7105232 (also available on AI makerspace) <br>
 • Goal: Detect Biomarkers given OCT images, and clinical labels <br>
  • You are free to choose your train/test splits <br>
  • You are free to choose your methods/evaluation <br>
 • Challenges you will be evaluated on <br>
  • How will you handle multi-modal data (images, text etc.)? <br>
  • What methods will you employ for evaluation? <br>
  • What analysis will you perform on results? <br>
  • How good are your results? <br>

   Deliverables: (More instructions when we approach the deadline) <br>
 • 25 Oct: “Progress” Report (PDF), needs to have the following <br>
 • Team members (Representative team member uploads the PDF) <br>
